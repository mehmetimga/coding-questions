![C++ Design Patterns: Structural][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Design patterns allow you to solve common software development problems in a reusable way, making your code more robust and scalable. In this course, Károly Nyisztor explores the structural design patterns from the Gang of Four. He shows you how to leverage these patterns in modern C++ code and how they can help you design more robust and scalable software. He also discusses the seven structural design patterns from the original design patterns book—adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, and proxy—and shows you how to implement each one in modern C++. For each pattern, he shows you when and how to use it, along with its benefits and drawbacks.
Join Károly in this course to learn how to apply structural design patterns in your own code and bolster your development skills.
